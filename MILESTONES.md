1  |  Subtasks that can be coded asynchronously ‚ôªÔ∏è

These items have few or no cross-dependencies, so multiple contributors can tackle them in parallel right away.
‚Ä¢YAML Schema Drafting
Define a recursive TaskNode schema that supports infinite nesting, completion flags, and per-node percentage override.
‚Ä¢Domain Model (Python)
Implement ArticleProject, TaskNode, and Checklist classes with CRUD methods and JSON/YAML (de)serialisation.
‚Ä¢CLI Argument Parser
Set up typer/argparse scaffolding; stubs for commands init, status, check, uncheck, rename, delete.
‚Ä¢Progress Calculator
Pure-function module that rolls up percentages from leaf nodes to the root.
‚Ä¢ASCII/Unicode Progress-Bar Renderer
Renders hierarchical bars with indentation‚Äîworks independently of the storage layer.
‚Ä¢Unit-Test Harness
Configure pytest plus coverage; write tests for schema validation, progress math, and CLI edge-cases.
‚Ä¢Continuous-Integration Pipeline
GitHub Actions: lint, type-check, test matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows, Py3.9-3.12).
‚Ä¢Packaging Skeleton
pyproject.toml, version bump script, entry-point spec.
‚Ä¢Documentation Boilerplate
MkDocs (or Sphinx) site with auto-generated API docs.

Because these modules interact only via public interfaces (e.g. TaskNode methods), teams can merge them in any order.

How to use this list
1.Assign developers to independent subtasks within the current milestone to maximise parallel throughput.
2.Gate work on any task under future milestones until the current milestone is merged‚Äîthis keeps PRs smaller and avoids re-work.
3.Promote ready-for-review tasks immediately; long-running items (e.g. GUI theming) can live in feature branches that track main nightly.
