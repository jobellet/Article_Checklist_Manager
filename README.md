# 📝 Article Checklist Manager

A lightweight graphical assistant for checking manuscript readiness. Upload a manuscript and optional figure files, pick the
submission journal, and see the exact changes required to satisfy the journal guidelines—all from the web interface.

🌐 Live site: https://article-checklist-manager.streamlit.app/

## 🐍 Python GUI installation
1. Create and activate a Python 3.9+ virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install .` (from the repository root).
3. Launch the Streamlit interface: `python -m acm.cli gui`.
4. Open the displayed local URL in your browser and upload your manuscript/figures to begin.

## 🎨 What the interface does
- **Upload manuscript (.docx, .txt, .md):** Parse sections and word counts directly in the browser.
- **Upload figures (optional):** Attach standalone figure files when they are not embedded in the manuscript. The upload is
  optional and will never block analysis.
- **Filter & pick a journal:** Narrow the dropdown with a text filter, then select the journal/article-type entry you want to
  target.
- **See required changes:** The interface lists every change needed (missing sections, word-limit overages, etc.) to meet the
  chosen guideline.
- **Figure awareness:** The app counts sequential "Figure n" references inside the manuscript so you can track how many
  figures are mentioned even if you skip uploads.

## 🚀 Getting started
1. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser (no backend required).
2. Click **Upload manuscript (.docx, .txt, .md)** and select your file.
3. (Optional) Click **Upload figures** to attach separate figure files.
4. Type in the **Filter journals** box to narrow the dropdown, then choose the target journal entry.
5. Review the **Required changes** list and update your manuscript accordingly.

Guideline data lives in [`journal_guidelines.json`](journal_guidelines.json). Update it if you need to add or tweak journal
requirements.

## 🛠️ Development notes
- All functionality runs in the browser; there is no CLI flow. Keep refactors GUI-first.
- `.docx` uploads are parsed client-side via [`JSZip`](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) to extract headings and word counts.
- If you adjust styles or markup, ensure the upload buttons, filter box, dropdown, and change list remain the primary
  controls—these form the core user journey.

## 🧭 Async-friendly task prompts for parallel PRs
- **Prompt 1 — Progress-aware manuscript worker**: "Extend `parsers/manuscript.worker.js` to emit incremental progress events
  while parsing `.docx`, `.md`, and `.txt` files and support cancellation messages. Update only the existing worker and the
  manuscript parsing wiring in `app.js` to display progress in `manuscript-status` without changing HTML structure."
- **Prompt 2 — Cached guideline bootstrap**: "Add `data/guidelines-cache.js` that reads/writes `localStorage` with a simple
  version key, and have `data/guidelines-loader.js` consult the cache before fetching `journal_guidelines.json`. Include
  coverage in `tests/guidelines-loader.test.js` for cache hit/miss/expiry behavior. No UI changes." (No overlap with Prompt 1
  because it is isolated to the data layer.)
- **Prompt 3 — Figure validation queue**: "Create `figures/figure-inspector.js` that validates uploaded figures (MIME/size)
  using a concurrency-limited queue and `Promise.allSettled`, and wire `app.js` to show per-file results in `figure-status`
  without altering manuscript parsing or guideline loading." (Touches only the new inspector module and the figure upload
  handler.)
- **Prompt 4 — Async export of analysis summary**: "Implement `export/export-utils.js` with a `buildAnalysisExport()` helper
  that assembles current sections, word counts, and selected guideline details into a downloadable JSON Blob. Add an export
  button in `index.html`, light styles in `styles.css`, and an `app.js` click handler that calls the helper without modifying
  upload or filtering behavior." (UI overlap limited to `index.html`/`styles.css`.)
- **Prompt 5 — Background guideline schema lint**: "Introduce `validate/validate-guidelines.worker.js` that checks
  `journal_guidelines.json` against `schemas/guideline-schema.json` off the main thread and reports status via
  `validate/validation-status.js`. Surface the status banner hookup in `app.js` only; do not touch figure/manuscript flows."
